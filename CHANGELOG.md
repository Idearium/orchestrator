# Orchestrator Changelog

## 1.0.0

This is the first cut of the code, after transferring from the Flashmedia repository.

### Features

- Automatic boostrapping of a Consul cluster.

### Platforms

Test on Docker Compose and Docker Cloud. Should work in other environments that support Docker's embedded DNS server (or works similarly by exposing service names as resolvable DNS entries).
